# Motion-planning-for-VIPs
Three different motion planning algorithms have been modified and implemented to meet blind people's requirements:
- Dijkstra
- RRT*
- Genetic Algorithm

These have been integrated with our version of ROS Navigation stack and the system has been evaluated with turtlebot.
Finally it has been integrated with the CUFF an haptic and wearable device with the goal of send stimuli/commands to visually impaired helping them in their navigation.
